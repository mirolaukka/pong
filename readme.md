# Pong Game - AI vs. AI

This is a modified version of the classic Pong game using the Python library `tkinter`, where two AI players (computers) play against each other. Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The game involves two paddles and a ball, and the AI players compete to score points by hitting the ball past each other's paddles.

## Requirements

To run the AI vs. AI Pong game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The game uses the `tkinter` library, which is included in the standard library of Python, so no additional installations are required.

## How to Watch the AI Game

1. **Launching the Game**: Execute the Python script, and the Pong game window will appear.

2. **Sit Back and Enjoy**: In this version, the AI players control both paddles and play against each other automatically. You do not need to provide any input during the game.

3. **Gameplay**: The game will start automatically, and the AI players will control the paddles to keep the ball in play. Each time the ball goes past one of the paddles, the opposing AI player scores a point.

4. **Winning**: The game continues until you close the window. You can observe the AI players' performance and see which AI manages to score more points.

## Customization

You can still customize various aspects of the game by modifying the constants in the code:

- `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`: Change the width and height of the game window.
- `PADDLE_WIDTH` and `PADDLE_HEIGHT`: Adjust the size of the paddles.
- `BALL_SIZE`: Change the size of the ball.
- `PADDLE_SPEED`: Adjust the speed of the paddles.
- `BALL_SPEED_X` and `BALL_SPEED_Y`: Change the horizontal and vertical speed of the ball.

Feel free to experiment with these values to create your desired AI vs. AI Pong game experience.
